Split engine control into Pause (soft) and Stop (hard). The dashboard Header now shows two buttons: "Pause AI engine" stops new work from being dispatched while letting in-flight agents finish gracefully, and "Stop AI engine" (previously the only Pause button) immediately kills all active agent sessions. A new `enginePaused` setting field controls the soft-pause state alongside the existing `globalPause` hard-stop.
